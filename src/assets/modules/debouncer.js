Debouncer v0.1
-----------------------------------------------

This pluggin will allows you to handle debouncing of your frequent/multiple function.procedure calls.

WARNING:
THIS IS NOT THROTTLING, AND THIS WILL NOT ACT AS IS

What is debounce:
Debounce will bunch a series of sequential calls to a function into a single call to that function.
It ensures that one notification is made for an event that fires multiple times.
* look here http://demo.nimius.net/debounce_throttle/

PARAMS:
timeout : Override default timeout. Timeout used as waiter last event calls
callback : list of callback action (after debounce), just like callback on settimeout function
*/

let awaiter = null

const debounce = (callback, timeout) => {
  clearTimeout(awaiter)

  awaiter = setTimeout(function () {
    callback()
  }, (timeout || 500))
}

export default debounce
